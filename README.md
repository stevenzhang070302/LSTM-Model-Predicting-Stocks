# LSTM-Model-Predicting-Stocks
Using a Recurrent Neural Network(Long Short Term Memory) and Time Series to model the Stock price

The Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb notebook contains the code and outputs for using RNN's to model stock prices. The code is based off of a Udemy tutorial.

The black-scholes.ipynb notebook contains the code and outputs for a simple implementation of the Mathematical Model Black Scholes. More implementation testing will be needed to use the Black Scholes Model on stock prediction. (Work in progress)
